### Negative Comments

**"Scam" / "Fake"**
```
Totally understand the skepticism—there's a lot of BS in this space! That's why we offer a free week with no credit card. Try it risk-free and decide for yourself 📊
```

**"Lost money using this"**
```
Sorry to hear that! Even with edges, variance happens. Our 47-21 record (69%) means we win 2 out of 3, but losing streaks are normal. Flat betting (1-2% of bankroll) helps weather variance. DM us if you want to talk strategy!
```

**"These picks are trash"**
```
Not every pick wins—that's gambling! We're about finding +EV edges over time. Our users are up +$1,247 on average this month. Long game > short results 📈
```

**"Too expensive"**
```
First week is FREE! And even our Pro plan breaks down to less than a coffee per day. If you're betting real money, the edge we find pays for itself 💰
```
