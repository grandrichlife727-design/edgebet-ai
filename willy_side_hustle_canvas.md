# 🎯 Willy’s Side Hustle Canvas (v1)
**Goal**: Generate $5k+/mo passive + semi-passive income → fund job exit within 12–18 months.

## 🧩 Core Assets
- Visual storytelling mastery (branding, packaging, motion)
- Sports industry insight (authenticity + fan psychology)
- Figma/Adobe + HTML/CSS/JS (can build MVPs, landing pages, automations)
- Existing client network & portfolio

## 🚀 Primary Streams (Priority Order)
1. **Niche Digital Products**  
   - *What*: “Sports Branding Kits” (Figma templates + brand guidelines + social assets) for indie teams, coaches, fitness influencers  
   - *Why*: Low overhead, high margin, leverages your exact expertise  
   - *Platform*: Gumroad + Carrd landing page (1-day build)

2. **Shopify Dropshipping (Design-Led)**  
   - *What*: Curate *aesthetic*, sports-adjacent merch (e.g., minimalist gym apparel, retro team posters, performance gear for niche sports like pickleball or trail running)  
   - *Edge*: You design the store, product mockups, ads — no generic AliExpress look  
   - *Test fast*: Use TikTok/Reels + Canva animations (you make them)

3. **Micro-SaaS / Tools for Designers**  
   - *What*: Tiny utilities: e.g., “Logo Color Palette Extractor” (upload logo → get HEX/RGB + accessibility report), or “Figma-to-Shopify Asset Exporter”  
   - *Build*: Next.js + Vercel (you can code it); monetize via Gumroad or Stripe

4. **Passive Content Licensing**  
   - *What*: Upload vector illustrations, motion graphics, or UI kits to Creative Market / Adobe Stock  
   - *Bonus*: Repurpose old client work (with permission) into generic kits
