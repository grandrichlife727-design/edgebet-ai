💡 BETTING TIP: The Kelly Criterion

Most bettors go broke by betting too much.

The Kelly Formula tells you optimal bet size:

f* = (bp - q) / b

Where:
b = odds - 1
p = probability of win
q = probability of loss (1-p)

Example:
75% confidence at -110 odds:
= (0.909 × 0.75 - 0.25) / 0.909
= 47.5% of bankroll

Most pros use "1/4 Kelly" for safety = ~12%
